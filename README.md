### Contributing translations

All translations are located in the src/main/resources/ directory. Some part partial translations, a few are fully translated.


If you want to translate the missing messages in a language, or add a translation for a new language, check out
[Wiki/Translating](https://github.com/SkyWars/SkyWars-Translations/wiki/Translating)!

When translating, you can test out your messages by copying them into the `messages.yml` file for SkyWars.

To see all currently untranslated messages in all currently existing language files, go to [Search/Untranslated](https://github.com/SkyWars/SkyWars-Translations/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Untranslated).
